Instructions:

1) Open main.html
2) Double-tap enlarges food group slice-size and opens item list

Concept Note


This is a rough prototype of an app interface that a door-to-door healthcare provider would use to create a personalised diet plan for her client. The idea is to include the client in the process to engage them, empower them and increase the likelihood of their following the diet plan.

The healthcare provider first adjusts the ratio of the different food groups that she would like the client to consume in the form of a pie-chart. When this is done, she drags and drops items from each group into the slices of the pie-chart. The food items being enclosed in the coloured shapes makes the separation and difference between them clear. She verbally counsels them about the characteristics of each food group, and why they should eat/avoid items of that food group.

Once she and the client are satisfied with the diet they have created, the client commits her plan. The app generates a report of the plan, and sends it to be stored in the organisation’s database. The organization then prints a diet-chart calendar and sends it to the client for self-reporting, to be reviewed on the provider’s next visit.
